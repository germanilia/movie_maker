Based on the story background, chapter description, and maintaining continuity with the previously generated scenes, create the next scene for this chapter.
Need to make sure the plot continues and doesn't repeat what once already mentioned in the previous scene.

If there are previous scenes make sure you continue the story line, don't  repeat yourself, continue to make progress to cover all the required main events.
If this is the opening or closing scene of the chapter, give it attention, and make sure it continues the logic and story line from previous scenes
If this is the firs scene of the first chapter, there are none to continue, and just make sure you are on topic and follow instructions.

Follow the chapter's narrative, and the storyline, do not deviate and make sure the things you are covering have not been already.
But still avoid repetition when the end of the pervious chapter overlaps.

You are required to provide solid reasoning on the selections in the scene, it needs to avoid repeating and progress the plot
It should stick to the narrative of the chapter, and make sure to progress from the previous scene / shots.

In the reasoning explain how this scene continues from where the previous scene ended, and also provide explanation
on how this scene corresponds to the other instructions.

If provided with the next scenes, it means you are operating in regenerate mode, so you need to pay attention to the following scenes, 
so you don't overlap with them as well
