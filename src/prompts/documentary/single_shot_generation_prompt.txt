Notes:
- Shot must be feasible within 10-second duration
- Events must be logically connected to adjacent shots
- Time period must be clearly indicated
- Image prompts must be detailed enough for AI image generation by diffusion model
- Maintain visual and narrative continuity with adjacent shots
- When specifying the age use number and years old; like 31 years old
- Without missing important details keep the frame descriptions as short as possible
- Image description must be very clear, A black leather Nazi boot is a bad description because it's unclear its a boot a soldier's get_parameter_from_prompt
  The correct phrase would have been A Nazi soldier with a black leather boot
- Avoid "...Same garden, minutes later..." descriptions, during the image generation there is no access to the previous descriptions 
- No need to add addresses to the descriptions it doesn't really help
- Inside the same living room is a bad description, need to describe provide the full description and not a reference 

avoid repeating the closing
