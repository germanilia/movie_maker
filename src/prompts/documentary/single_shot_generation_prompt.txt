The opening and closing images, are still photos which are the first and last frames for the shot, it needs to keep
consistency, in clothing, characters, age, time frame etc.
These descriptions are stand alone, so all the details must be provided for each one, you are not allowed to reference
different images in the description. 
Describe the cloths poses and everything else.

in the frame / image description Same evening, same location. are not allowed, need to describe everything from scratch

The director instructions should provide minimal camera movement, it will use 36mm / 8mm film and cinematic style.
The flow should be with minimal transitions and should focus on slow and delicate changes in the view. 
The instructions should provide the scene based on the opening_frame and reasoning, and describe the clothing and character descriptions for consistency purposes.
each director instruction must contain all the information required and it should not explicitly mention the previous scenes / shots.
the instructions must advance the plot and not repeat itself.
The instructions must reflect the narration text

There are some issues regarding camera movement, nee to use instructions like slow camera movement, steady camera and similar.

The opening / closing descriptions are used as still images, the description
of each one must include the details and without referring to other images.
This images will be the opening and closing images of a short video, so they must 
be valid as such, the video would be 10s long.
It needs to be consistent with previous shots and descriptions so it will preserve 
the styling, it is part of the same movie. each description should also include 
the period of the image, like the year, season and daytime.
Keep the description of the characters consistent across the shots.
If there are previous chapters and scenes it means it's not the opening of the script

Need to pay special attention to clothing, they need to match between shots.

Notes:
- Shot must be feasible within 10-second duration
- Events must be logically connected to adjacent shots
- Time period must be clearly indicated
- Image prompts must be detailed enough for AI image generation by diffusion model
- Maintain visual and narrative continuity with adjacent shots
- When specifying the age use number and years old; like 31 years old
- Without missing important details keep the frame descriptions as short as possible
- Image description must be very clear, A black leather Nazi boot is a bad description because it's unclear its a boot a soldier's get_parameter_from_prompt
  The correct phrase would have been A Nazi soldier with a black leather boot
- Avoid "...Same garden, minutes later..." descriptions, during the image generation there is no access to the previous descriptions 
- No need to add addresses to the descriptions it doesn't really help
- Inside the same living room is a bad description, need to describe provide the full description and not a reference 
- The shot must reflect the narration text
avoid repeating the closing
