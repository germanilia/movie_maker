Current script:
{script}

Regenerate narration instructions:
{regenerate_narration_instructions}

The response must start with a {{ and end with }} nothing is allowed before or after and never use new lines in the response
In the reasoning explain why the narration text was selected, it the narration should be the the text going to be said during the scene, 
not the instructions for the narration. 
This is a bad example:
{{
    "reasoning": "The narration text was selected because it is a good example of a narration that fits the instructions",
    "narration": "The story should be told from my personal perspective, focusing on vivid sensory details and emotional moments ...."
}}


The output format should be a json object with the following fields:
{{
    "reasoning": "Explain in detail why this narration was chosen and how it fits with the script and the regenerate narration instructions",
    "narration": "The new narration for the script, which should be in the same style as the original narration but with the new instructions, this is the actual narration text"
}}
