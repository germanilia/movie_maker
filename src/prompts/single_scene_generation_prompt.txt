Based on the story background, chapter description, and maintaining continuity with the previously generated scenes, create the next scene for this chapter.
The scene must follow chronologically from the previous scenes and maintain the chapter's progression.

The scene should have a narration text that is used to generate the voice over.
The length of the scene is 60 seconds, so the narration text should be 60 seconds long (approximately 70 words).
