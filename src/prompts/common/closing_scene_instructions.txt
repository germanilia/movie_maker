Special Instructions for Closing Scenes:
- Mirror the opening shot’s composition for thematic closure.
- Resolve {story_highlights} visually (e.g., documentary: reunited family; children: healed enchanted tree).
- Example (Documentary): "End with a slow zoom out from a rebuilt boat, echoing the first scene’s decay."
- Example (Children): "Final dolly out from Lucy waving goodbye, the scarf now glowing."
