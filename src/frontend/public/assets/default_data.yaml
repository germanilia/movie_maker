        My Early Years

        Amsterdam, 17 April 1937
        Saturday evening, at approximately seven p.m., must have
        been a very exciting time for the proud parents after finding
        out that a baby boy was born.It was their first born.The
        birth was not an easy one, and as complications arose spe-
            cial instruments were required.Great care was taken with
        the delivery, but despite the extreme care, some injury to
        the newborn occurred.Everything possible was being done
        to minimize the damage, and overall the staff succeeded,
            though a small dent in the forehead remained.With the
        passing years it would almost disappear.
        As the years went by, because of the inadequate finan -
            cial situation and political uncertainties that prevailed at
        the time, it proved to be their first and only child.
        Of the years that passed on Zuider Amstel laan 72, corner
        of Waalstraat 64, I almost have no recollection at all.The
        only memories from that time are the ones that are por -
            trayed on a 8 mm black and white movie film that Father
        made around the time that I was five years of age, about
        two years into the war.The spool of film, the camera and
        the projector were buried in the garden of the Zuider Amstel
        laan 72, the ground floor residence, in a wooden case that
        was specially built to store the equipment.After the war, it
        was retrieved intact.
        The camera and projector were in use until the 1960ís,
            and I still have the 8 mm black and white movie film.
        These Memories start with the following traumatic recol -
            lection.

        My Early Years
        FallóNovember 1942
        It was evening, dark and cold out -
            side: childrenís bedtime.I said
        good night to my parents as usual
        and went to my room.Just as I was
        passing the entrance door in the
        hall connecting the living room to
        the bedrooms, holding a half eaten
        apple in my hand, all of a sudden
        there was a terrible crashing noise:
        a large boot came through the
        wooden entrance door, stuck there
        The Yellow Star that I wore
        on my coat, still is in my
        possession.
        for a few seconds, then started to
        trample the rest of the door to pieces, until a man in a green
        uniform came through, yelling ìraus, rausî(ìget out, get
        outî).
        In my fright I threw the apple in the direction of my
        bedroom and ran back to my parents, who sadly picked me
        up.Without saying anything, we left our apartment.
        Once in the street we met many of our neighbors.Trau -
            matic collections of thoughts, with great lapses in time,
            occur.We were taken to a neighborhood school on Euterpa
        Street(now Gerrit van de Veen Street) which was turned into
        a registration and collection place.Men and women were
        separated; children mostly stayed with their mothers.It
        took hours and hours; nobody had any regard for the eld -
            erly, the sick, the tired or whatever.
        From there the ìtrappedî were marched off, never to be
        seen again.
            Tired, afraid, and cold, I was only scantily dressed and
        wearing my coat with the yellow Star of David with the
        inscription Jood(Jew), which robbed me of my freedom.
        We stood there, in the dark, huddled with a multitude
        4
        FallóNovember 1942
        of people in the school square.
        I was crying, and it got on the nerves of one of the Nazi
        soldiers standing close by.He told my Mother, ìKeep him
        quiet.î Mother answered, ìWhat do you want from him, he
        wants his father.î The soldier went away, and after a while
        came back with Father.He said ìCome quickly, and be
        quiet.î The three of us were escorted home under the cover
        of darkness.The soldier had arranged an ausweis, a tempo -
            rary release; arriving at home my parents were told, ìDonít
        be here in the morning as we are coming back to catch the
        ones that we missed.î By daybreak we were gone, we were
            in hiding.
        ìAusweisî written in German.
            Translation: The Jew, Obstfeld Adolf, next to his Wife and Child, are allowed
        to be on the street between 21.00 and 22.00 hours.

        My Early Years
        Going Underground
        As I was told in later years, our living quarters before the
        trouble startedóZuider Amstel laan 72, corner of Waalstraat
        64ówere absolutely comfortable.
        Large spacious rooms, first floor, a corner buildingóthe
        surrounding streets were in what was considered a good
        and pleasant neighborhood.
        The war started on the tenth of May in the year 1940
        when German aircraft bombarded the city of Rotterdam, in
            those years the ìgatewayî harbor to the bordering coun -
            tries, and by the Nazi regime seen as an open waterway to
        the hinterland.One can take a boat ride on the mighty
        Rhine river and go upstream until the waterfalls of Schaff -
            hausen.The Dutch army held back the attacking forces for a
        mere five days.
        After that the Royal Family escaped to safety in
            England.
        The Netherlands was overrun by the enemy.It took
        them time to organize and to dominate the population; on
        the other hand, the population also started to organize.
        Many clandestine, concealed groups of people created a
        movement known as Het Verzet(translated as The Resis -
            tance) or ìThe Underground.î
        M
        One of our neighbors, in one of the adjacent apartments,
            was a Christian mother with two sons.In the early days
        many evenings were spent in furious debates about the
        pros and cons of the ìnewî Nazi regime.
        The mother was torn between her two sons.One of
        them was on the side of the civilians; he was solidly anti -
            Nazi, was against the war and had already forged connec -
            tions to the underground movement of which he was a
        6
        Going Underground
        active member(the good son).The other son was pro - Nazi
        and had joined a group known as the ìBlack Police, î
        named after the color of their uniform(the bad son).They
        collaborated with the enemy and were extremely danger -
            ous, as they could not be trusted in any way.It was a group
        that benefited from the turmoil that the Nazis created.
        During one of the last evenings, according to Fatherís
        account, when all of them were at home, a heated discus -
            sion and loud voices came from the neighborsí apartment.
        It ended by the mother forbidding her bad Nazi son from
        ever entering the house again.
        The good son said to his mother, ìIíll take care of you,
            donít worry.î
        The bad son, upon leaving, said, ìIíll get all of you.
        Youíll be sorry, we will win this waróand your objections
        will not stop me.î
        The mother and her good son, sometime during the fol -
            lowing years, perished in the war.The bad son survived the
        terrible hostilities.After the war he was recognized by
        many civilians, remembered for his deeds, and caught and
        put on trial; it was his turn to be robbed of his freedom.
        During his trial my mother had enough courage to go to
        the court and testify.After all, it was he who betrayed her.
        He received a life sentence, and was to spend the rest of
        his life in jail.He lived for a scant five years; one day he was
        found dead in his cell, and we were officially notified of his
        death.
            M
        Tolla Schnitzer, Mother, was placed in hiding by a doc -
            tor on the Koninginne Weg in Amsterdam.Unfortunately,
            one day she looked through the window of the apartment
        at street levelójust for an instant: for a fraction of a second
        7
        My Early Years
        she moved the curtain a bit to get a glimpse of daylight.She
        was seen and recognized by a passerby: the former neigh -
            borsí(bad) son, by now a notorious member of the Dutch
        collaborators to the Nazis.Within hours the Gestapo called
        upon the residence, instantly killing the doctor and his
        wifeóby shootingóas punishment for hiding a Jew.
        Mother was taken prisoner and brought to the Wetering -
            schans house of detention.After processing she was trans -
            ported, on 6 June 1944, to Westerborg, a concentration camp
                in the Dutch province of Drente.
        There she lived in Baracke 85, and in the camp she
        worked as a childrenís nurse in Gruppe 8DB.xx1 Kinderort.
        While in the Westerbork Camp,
            working in Baracke 35 - 36 as a chil -
            drenís nurse, she met a nice little
        boy with blond hair and blue eyes,
            who was the same age as me, her
        own son.Tolla did not know where
        I(her own son) was; she had abso -
            lutely no information about my
        whereabouts.I do not know, if Ö
        maybe there was a thought of,
            ìWell, is it he or is it not.î In later
        years, when we talked about it,
            Mother said, ìWell, what do you
        Tilla Obstfeld - Schnitzer
        Picture taken in
            Westerborg June 1944
        thinkóI did not know my own
        child ? î Her explanation was that she did not think that the
        Nazis would be as cruel to children as they were to the
        adult population.She reasoned that children, for certain,
            would get better treatment and food.Well, she misunder -
            stood the situation, to say the least.
        But in her belief she took the boy with her and took care
        of him.
        8
        Going Underground
        Willie was only five years old.
        He had been playing outside his parental home when a
        German soldier passed by.ìLittle boy, î he said, ìdo you
        want a chocolate bar ? î Willie answered, ìSure.î The soldier
        then said, ìIf you tell me that you are Jewish, Iíll give you
        one.î He was swept away in the crowds that were picked
        up all over the country, processed, transported and resur -
            faced in the camp by the Gruppe 8DB.xx1 Kinderort.
        They stayed together.Maybe it gave Mother her
        strength to endure; wherever her wanderings, whatever the
        hardship during this time, she and Willie were inseparable.
        She took him to her living quarters where they slept on the
        same rough wooden planks that served as their bed.More
        than once Willie was sick; she took care of him, shared his
        ailments and his suffering.
            M
        On a subsequent visit to Hol -
            land in the summer of 1999, I ven -
            tured a visit to Camp Westerbork, in
                the province of Drente.
        My research and curiosity into
        the happenings of family members
        brought me to this place, as this was
        the main transit point for all Dutch
        Jews.Today all that is visible from
        that time is a museum which tells
        only a small part of the story.
        From this place, during the
        years 1942 - 1945, more than 107,000
        Monument in Westerbork
        persons were deported to the vari -
            ous concentration camps in Eastern Europe and murdered.
        (These statistics were supplied by the Nazis; they do not
        9
        My Early Years
        include survivors.)
        Almost every weekóusually on Tuesdayóa train
        departed with the required number of persons.The train,
        consisting of cattle cars, carried the sign, ìAuschwitz
        Express.î
        Ripped up and warped railway tracks that symbolize that from this place
        trains will never leave again
        It was in the ìMemorial Hall of the Namesî that I
        found, among the many volumes of books, the names of my
        relatives inscribed in full detail: name, date and place of
        birth, and date and place of the victimís murder.
        M
        In the beginning of September 1944 my mother was
        shipped, together with Willie, by train, in a closed cattle
        wagon: packed with hundreds of other people, with no
        place to sit, no doors or windows with very little food and
        water.The train ride took a few days and nights, and many
        did not survive; it was destined for one of the extermination
        10
        Going Underground
        camps in Poland.
        There was no hurry getting to the destination, and
        speed was not of primary concern; the end terminal had to
        be notified and preparations had to be made to receive a
        trainload of captives for destruction.
        Evidently, by mistake, the train was switched onto
        other tracks that led to a different direction.This train went
        to the Theresienstadt(Terezin) concentration camp near
        Prague, where Mother continued to work in the childrenís
        department and was known only by her identity number:
        1739 - XXIV / 7.
        Theresienstadt was known to be a ìmodel camp.î During
        the war foreign dignitaries, mostly persons representing the
        Red Cross, came from time to time to see the camp ìshow -
        piece;î it would be put on display, the regime would show
        how good they care for the inmates, how wonderful they
        had it there.Of course most of the camp was a restricted
        area that nobody was allowed to see.
        That is where the real tragedies unfolded.
        Prisoners drawing of main building for ìdisinfecting and shower facilities: î
        the gas chambers
        11
        My Early Years
        The Theresienstadt Concentration
        Camp
        Terezin, as it is called in the Czech language, (Czechoslova -
        kia was then united) is situated about 60 kilometers north of
        Prague.
        Kaiser Jozef II made the place into a fortified military
        town in the year 1780 and named it after his famous
        mother.
        In 1942 it was decided in Berlin to make this already ex -
            military fortified town into a ìBohemian Protectorate, î
        where, at the beginning, approximately 7000 persons lived.
        During the three years of its existence, under the strict SS
        regime, more than 120,000 persons lived or passed through
        the camp, most of them political prisonersóeducated per -
        sons and intellectuals who would receive ìspecial treat -
            ment.î
        The Ghetto comprised ten side streets that crossed the
        six parallel running main streets and a market square.All of
        the buildings were of the old military barracks type, which
        suited the present regime quite well.
        Inmate Tolla Obstfeld, Trsp.Nr.XXIV / 7 - 1739, lived in
        the Lange Gasse Nr. 5.
        Another surprise awaited her in Theresienstadt.She
        met her brother in law, Fatherís brother Moritz, and his
        wife Renee.She never spoke much about her time in the
        camp, except the story that, when Moritz was almost at the
        end of his strengthóbecause of overwork and beatings
        from the guardsóshe gathered all her energy, nerve and
        courage, and went out of her barracks and crawled to the
        kitchen at night after curfew.She knew the way, as she had
        gone there on duty during the days to fetch food for the
        children.Of course she could not go the regular way; she
        dug out a cavity under the barbed wire at the rear of the
        12
        The Theresienstadt Concentration Camp
        kitchen entrance, went in, and stole as much food as she
        could carry.She repeated these journeys a number of times,
        and Willie also benefited from those outings as extra rations
        came in.Surely it helped Moritz endure his ordeal and sur -
        vive the camp.
        The ghetto camp was well camouflaged; to outsiders,
        such as the Red Cross and others who came to visit from
        time to time, it looked like a normal town: flower beds
        along the main avenues, sidewalk cafÈs on the Market
        Square; there were concerts and opera performances, a
        library with real books, shops were you could ìbuyî any -
        thing you wanted(all the goods were stolen from the vic -
            tims anyway).There was a bank, and ìrealî money.
        Money existed in notes of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 Kronen.Each note has
        another color.Higher denominations are increasingly larger and they have a
        watermark and serial numbers.Money is dated 1 January 1943.
        I have the entire set.Its value has never been established because it is
        unknown how many sets survived.This set was on display at the Chase
        Manhattan Bank, NY City Branch, in the 1960s.
        13
        My Early Years
        The prisoners had to work and were paid an average
        ìsalaryî of fifty Kronen per month.
        Those too weak, or too sick, would perish from their ail -
        ments.
        And all the time regular scheduled transportsótrains
        with open or closed cattle carsóarrived and departed with
        their cargo of human suffering.
        Arrivals were transports coming mostly from the west -
        ern European countries: Jews and other undesirables,
            rounded up, caught and in transit.
        Transports departed to the camps of Auschwitz and
        Birkenau to fuel the ovens, to execute the ìfinal solution.î
        Shrouded in secret, gas chambers were being readied to
        dispose of the entire camp population, if and when the
        word would arrive from Berlin.
        The people knew and understood what was going on;
        they were the victims, they were brutally beaten, worked as
        slave laborers, died from hunger, disease and cold, they
        could do nothing to protect themselves, nothing ever
        changed, thousands and thousands died in this ìModel
        Camp.î
        The Red Cross visitors came and went.They were kept
        well away from the inhabitants.The Red Cross knew what
        was going on but there was very little they did to alleviate
        the suffering.
        On the tenth of May 1945 a regiment of the Russian
        Army arrived, liberating the camp.
        They could not believe what they saw.
        On the twenty - second of May 1945, together, Mother
        and Willie(she was unwilling to separate from him) were
        sent with the remainder of Dutch survivors on their journey
        home, to Holland.
        They arrived on 9 June 1945 in Eindhoven, at a center for
        14
        The Theresienstadt Concentration Camp
        returning displaced persons.
        After landing at the small
        airport in Eindhoven in a mili -
        tary transport aircraft, the Red
        Cross took over; they were
        both medically checked,
        turned inside out, received
        injections, against and for all
        kind of ailments and diseases
        prevalent at the time, as the
        registration card no.B
        00179338 indicates.
        After that Willie was re -
        united with his parents.

        Tolla became ìfriendly, î as far as such friendship goes
        in those circumstances, with some women who were placed
            in the same barracks with her.
        Even after the war, they stayed in touch.
        Over the years they became real friends, sharing, but
        rarely mentioning, the tragedies and suffering that they
        endured.

        In September 1942 he received a certificate stating that
        he would not be harmed and would be ìa free Jewî because
        his work and business, as a furrier, made him essential to
        the occupier.He was active in the underground movement
        all the years of occupation; one of his many jobs, for exam -
        ple, was the pasting and distributing of billboards, illegal
        newspapers, picking up information about the enemy, and,
        above all, checking the ìlistingsî of those who were
        ìwanted.î He was arrested a number of times but he
        always turned out to be innocent.It was his partner and
        friend Adriaan Hornkamp who was tormented.Father
        lived in the Kanaal Straat 42, opposite the Hornkamp family.

        Occupied City
        Adolf Obstfeld, alias Eduard Zeller, (sometimes Seller)
        occupation ìFurrierî according to the official letter a ìFree
        Jew, î lived through the entire period of the war in a occu -
        pied city, Amsterdam.He engaged in his trade and man -
            aged his workshop.
        It goes without saying that the workshop needed man -
        power.Under the circumstances, skilled or expert furrier
        qualifications were overlooked; the main thing was that
        those employed in this particular workshop were free for
        the time being, according to the proclamation the occupier
        itself had posted on the premises.Father, an active member
        of the Underground, managed to play both side of the
        fence.On the one hand he saved numerous persons who
        had to report for ìwork detail, î which was another name
        for ìyou are being deported toÖî
        Persons went undercover, though places of conceal -
        ment were few and could not be found quickly enough.
        Until one could find a suitable place, he might turn up at
        the ìFirm A.Obstfeld Furriersî and take a breather.
        (Freigestellten Juden)
        After a while the organization would find a suitable
        hiding place and the person would simply disappear.The
        explanation was always the same after a disappearance.
        ìYou pick up people on the street, from their homes;
        you haul them away or you just shoot them, î Father would
        simply say to them.ìHow should I know where they are ?
        You are the reason that my workers vanish!î
        The Germans slowly found out about the conspiracy
        and told Father, ìObstfeld, you will be the last to go, we
        will make sure that you receive your deserved punish -
        ment.î They placed a guard at the workshop during work -
            ing hours to supervise and check what was going on, but
        17
        My Early Years
        the cheating continued.
        On the other hand, he ran errands, distributed and col -
        lected information; many times the guards would talk,
            sometimes unknowingly revealing important information.
        They were not aware that, in turn, they were being observed
        and listened too.Such information had to be passed on as
        quickly as possible.
        The ìFirm A.Obstfeld Furriers, î at the premises van
        Baerle straat 7, (at that time a dead end street) did its best to
        break up the enemyís daily routine.
        There were many such ìcellsî at work in the city.It was
        an extremely dangerous business.
        Yet it was strange that Father was not harmed in any
        way, that he came through the suffering in relative good
        shape and health.He rarely mentioned, in later years, the
        happenings and goings on in the workshop.He also never
        mentioned any names.
        Of course his closest collaborator and comrade was
        Adriaan Hornkamp.

        My Early Years
        Amsterdam
        It was afternoon; there was an uproar in the Haarlemmer
        Buurt, an area not far from the central railway station, going
        in a westerly direction.
        The uproar spilled over in the street down below, a few
        houses further from where we lived.My foster - father Dirk Hei -
        nen, an auto / motor - bicycle mechanic, said to me ìYou stay here
        and donít make a sound, î while he ran out the apartment on his
        way to see what the commotion outside was all about.We lived on
        the second floor.Mother Martha told her son Dick and me, ìGo
        play in your room, stay away from the window.î We went to our
        room.I hated to play with him because it was always the same
        game: playing marbles.I always lost to Dick, even if I was win -
        ning; I still lost because every time at the end of a game, he always
        had one more marble: his glass eye.
        Outside the commotion became worse, people were scream -
        ing.We heard a noise like shooting.I didnít know what was hap -
        pening; Mother Martha was suddenly gone too, and I was alone
        with Dick, a kid much younger than myself.We were scared and
        curious.I went to the little balcony to see what was going on down
        in the street.People were running in all directions: crackling
        sounds, gunshots filled the air.I turned around, frightened; I
        wanted to go back into the apartment when a strong hand picked
        me up, held his other hand over my mouth and told me, ìI am
        here to save you, not a sound out of you.î As I was taken away I
        saw Dick sitting on the floor in a corner crying, and somewhere
        along the way I heard Mother Martha screaming, ìKidnappers!
        They took the boy!î
        Later in life I learned that it was a set - up.The Under -
        ground had been waiting for a long time for something to
        happen in the neighborhood that would give them the
        opportunity to whisk me away from a family that was
        using this unfortunate situation to extort money: using
        20
        Amsterdam
        blackmail to boost their financial gains.
        Every week, when someoneósometimes my Fatherócame to
        check up on me and to see if everything was going all right, Dirk
        Heinen had no difficulty or mental torment asking for monetary
        compensation.With every visit the price would double, and the
        amount of money that he asked for became impossible to deliver;
        the man would then say, ìWell, you know what is going to hap -
        pen: the Gestapo will gladly take this little boy, î and once more he
        would succeed in extracting a huge sum of moneyóbut clearly it
        was decided that this must stop; the risk much too dangerous, and
        appropriate steps were taken and plans for ìthe kidnapî was
        arranged.I stayed about two or three months at that place.
        Later that evening, under cover of darkness, I was
        deposited in an attic hideout with the Hornkamp family.
        One of the worst memories of that locationóIíll never
        be able to forget itówas about our playmate and pet ani -
        mal, a rabbit.We(their son Dick and I) received this rabbit
        to keep us company, to play with and to keep us occupied.
        It was a fun animal: nice, furry with long ears.It ate some
        green vegetable leaves, as food was rather scarce.
        Then, one day, Father Dirk came to us just as we were
        playing with our pet, grabbed our lovely rabbit, and went
        with it to the bathroom.He had rigged there some kind of
        hook over the sink; with a swift motion of his hand he cut
        the rabbitís throat and hung it on the hook over the sink.
        The animal was screaming, jumping and dripping blood, as
        we stood helpless, watching the rabbit bleed to death.
        ìTonight we will have a fine dinner, î he said, turning
        around and leaving us alone.
        That evening our playmate was served as food.I ran
        away from the table.
        That night, I did not eat and went to bed hungry and
        sad.
        21
        My Early Years
        The Hornkamp Family
        A typical walk - up three - room apartment in the Kanaal
        Straat # 37 where an average family lived, a standard
        household: husband Adriaan, a tool and die maker, his wife
        Elisa and their two daughters, Adriana and Lies.The excep -
        tional objective of this family, like many others, was that
        they did not submit to the oppression as laid down by the
        conquerors.They too closed ranks with those who worked
        to safeguard mankind against all the hazards and complica -
        tions involved.
        The small room set aside for this purpose contained a
        core of four constantly - hidden people and a number of oth -
        ers in transit to other hiding places.
        Huddled together in silence, each one with his own thoughts;
        from time to time the family would organize a ìsafety drillî that
        would involve someone ringing the bell, opening the door slowly
        with the question ìWho is thereîóand before anyone could walk
        up the stairs to the apartment the occupants had to lift themselves
        into a crawl space between the ceiling and the floorboards of the
        apartment a floor higher.There was almost no room to hide in
        there; it was not an easy exercise.
        When I arrived I was quickly reminded by those present the
        rules of the game: absolute silence, no sneezing, no coughing, no
        talking except for the occasional whisper, in short to be as quite as
        a mouse, and above all not to forget that we were in hiding and in
        danger.One wrong moveóa sound or other disturbanceócould
        jeopardize everyone.Not all the inhabitants of the building were
        of the sympathetic kind.It had to be assumed that even the walls
        had ìears.î The residents of the building had no idea that people
        were hiding right in their midst.
        After a few days in this shelter, one eveningóagain, as
        always, under cover of darknessóI was taken away from
        this hideaway.
        22
        The Hornkamp Family
        A better place was found for me, far away, out in the
        countryside.
        M
        The evening was long and cold.We were hungry, and
        not to speak of being tired.ìSsssttt, be quiet;î the crackling
        sounds of the dried up pieces of forest twigs and dried
        leaves under our feet were rather noisy as we walked
        through the woods, it could give us away, absolute silence
        had to be maintained at all times.
        It was nerve - racking for Angela Leoni, a young girl of 22, a
        student who took it upon herself to bring me to safety.She was a
        courier in those days.Her brother, Kurt E.Leoni, was also a stu -
        dent and led one of the many underground units that brought
        people to safety.As we came closer to our destination we were
        joined by a young man by the name of Ben who knew the local
        area like the palm of his hand; he would accompany us to our des -
        tination.It was a farm somewhere in the province of Gelderland.
        According to my fatherís recollections, I did not stay very long at
        this hideaway, for the farmerís household did not know what to
        do with me, as I refused to eat.Besides that, they thought that I
        was too weak.They had hoped for a strong little fellow who could
        work and be useful around the farm, not a frail little guy who
        looked sick to them.
        Angela Leoni again came to pick me up, and again our
        wanderings took us through the woods of the Veluwe, as the
        area is still known.We arrived in a small village by the
        name of Hattem, and at the small local railway station we
        met Ben again.
        Finally we arrived at a ìrest stop:î the house of the local
        physician in this small village.His home was designated by
        the underground as a ìsafe house, î a place, where one
        could have some rest and get something to eat or drink.
        23
        My Early Years
        Hattem
        Hattem, in the years 1940 -
        1945, was a small village of
        about 5000 inhabitants
        south of the town of Zwolle,
        across the river IJssel, in the
        farmlands of the province of
        Gelderland.
        It is positioned between
        the grasslands(polder) bor -
        dering the river and the
        woodlands of the area
        known as the Veluwe.
        It is an old Hanseatic town, which was a confederation
        of North European trading cities.The seven Hanse cities on
        the banks of the IJssel are Kampen, Zwolle, Hattem, Deven -
        ter, Zutphen en Doesburg.
        The earliest mention of the place, in the year 891, was of
        a settlement on the banks of the river.Steadily the commu -
        nity grew, and in the year 1299 Hattem received its ìCity
        Rights, î and about a hundred years later it became a forti -
        fied city.
        The fortifications consisted of a canal and a wall sur -
        rounding the city, a number of tower gates that gave access
        to the inner city; the towers were used as a lookout for its
        defense.Today only a part of the old surrounding wall and
        the ìDike Gateî still remain.Hattem has protected and pre -
        served its Old City and historical sites with an elaborate
        conservation program; it reconditioned many old buildings
        24
        Hattem
        after the war, and at the same time repaired the damages
        endured during the war years.
        The center of town consisted of a wide street that split
        into two parallel running streets: Kerkstraat(Church Street)
        and Achterstraat(Back Street) going in an easterly direction
        and ending in a square, Kerkplein(Church Square), forming
        something like a triangle.In the middle of the Town Square
        stands the local church.On the other end, in a westerly
        direction, a wide road called Dorpsweg(Village Road) leads
        to the newer area and out of town.
        Along this road was a school building, the local head -
        quarters of the Nazi occupiers.A very short distance in
        front the school, along the road at an ìTî intersection, a
        country roadóEijerdijkóstarts in a southerly direction
        away from the center.Before reaching the single railway
        track are a couple of houses, and the one with the gray tiled
        roof was my new hiding place, a very large house.
        Past the railway tracks, a bit further down, the road dis -
        appeared into the woods, known as the property of Mole -
        caten.

        On my visit to Hattem in July 1998, on the invitation of
        the Archives Department of the City of Hattemóand dur -
        ing the consequent visit to City HallóI was confronted
        with the past.Memories came back, many new details
        which I did not understand as a child became known to me.
        The property of the Estate Molecaten in the woods of the
        Veluwe, within the boundaries of the town of Hattem,
        played a very important role during the war.
        On the property a number of Jewish persons were hid -
        den, though, unfortunately they were detected, caught, and
        transported to the concentration camps.
        One young couple lived for about a year under an over -
        turned bathtubóthe old large metal kind that stood on
        legs.Under it the earth was dug out and disposed of.It
        gave them shelter and was invisible because the entrance
        was under the bathtub.
        There were others who lived in huts hastily fabricated
        from the available materials in the woods.A nearby farmer
        supplied them with food and other necessities of life,
        including medicines, which in those days came as a liquid
        in little bottles.
        Some of those bottles, thrown about the grounds, still
        had a label on them with the name and address of the phy -
        sician who supplied them: the same as my hiding place.
        No wonder that suspicion arose about the physician in
        question.
        Another point of friction was Dr.van Haeringenís
        repeated refusal to remove the ìdoctorî sign in front of the
        house which caused many surprise visits and discussions
        with the authorities.He convinced them that the sign
        should stay; otherwise, he said, they themselves would not
        know where to go in case of need, or to get treatment if they
        became sick.

        meters away as the crow flies.
        On warm summer nights, when the windows were
        open, we could hear the soldiers laughing, singing melo -
        dies about their ìFatherland.î
        In Hattemís City Hall, next to the entrance in the confer -
        ence room, is a Memorial Book with the names of sixteen
        Jewish persons who were concealed on the Estate Molecaten.
        What gave them away were the tracks left behind during
        the winter of 1944 from those who tried to help them.
        Only one person came back alive after having survived
        the ordeals of the camps.
        The Memorial Book also mentions numerous citizens of
        Hattem who perished during the war while combating the
        enemy in various capacities.

        passed awayómore information about the war years were
        made available to me by going through old documents, let -

        Aaltje Oostenbrink, born on 13 February 1910, Dedems -

        Oostenbrink and Hermina Harwig.
        and
        Pieter van Haeringen, born on 21 December 1908,
        Dedemsvaart, died on 18 July 2002 in Apeldoorn, was one
        of eight children, (Willem, Arie, Johanna, Katrina, Anna
        Hendrika, Willem, Anna Hendrika), born to Hendrik van
        Haeringen and Roelofje van Haeringen.
        They lived in the Province of Overijssel.Much about
        their early years as children is not known.Both finished
        their schooling and went on to higher studies.
        Pieter van Haeringen successfully finished his studies
        at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Groningen,
        on 13 December 1935, where upon he received the title of
        General Practitioner.

        working at home together with her husband.The pharmacy
        was in the giant house.
        They married on 10 June 1937 at the municipality of
        Avereest in the province of Overijssel.
        Later they moved to their home in Hattem, which is in
        the province of Gelderland.

        They ordered the construction of their residence on a
        plot of land located at the Eijerdijk, known as Section D.No
        2287. The contract was signed on 1 November 1936. Upon
        its completion they moved into their newly - built house.

        My Early Years
        Architectural Design of House
        About their early years, of how the young couple set -
        tled, not much is known to me.It was a subject that was
        never discussed.
        I know that they ordered the construction of their home.
        The drawing above is the architectural design, but the
        planned garage under the house never materialized; it was
        built closer to the street at the end and outside of the gar -
        den.
        When I came upon the scene in 1942 the medical prac -
        tice was well developed, including the pharmacy, with all
        the equipment prevalent at that time.The house was per -
        fectly furnished with the most elegant furniture.Some of it
        was made to order: skillfully crafted from solid oak wood
        with special patterns carved into beautiful designs.It was a
        pleasant and comfortable homeóand not to forget that it
        was a ìsafeî home.

        The newly married couple
        Thursday, the 10th of June 1936, must have been an exciting day, and I am
        inclined to believe that everything must have been perfect, because such was
        the character of the bride and groom.They were married for 63 years, and as
        the saying goes, ìTill death does us partî
        Picture taken in 1936
        This cabinet stood in the hallway next to a matching wooden bench, both
        made of hand - carved oak.This combination gave a ìsafeî and robust feeling;
        many times I huddled in the corner between the cabinet and the bench.
        At the time it was taller than I was.

        My Early Years
        The House
        The home reflected that it was the residence of a general
        practitioner who was authorized to keepóand defiantly
        keptóhis physicians practice going; after all, the soldiers of
        the occupying forces also needed a doctor from time to
        time.
        It was a Saturday night at around eight oíclock in the
        evening when a secret group of night wanderers, cold,
        tired, and thirsty, arrived at the kitchenís back door, one of
        the many entrances of the house.They entered quickly,
        moved silently to a rather dimly - lit dining room.
        A large heavy oak table surrounded with equally heavy
        chairs occupied the center of the room.The curtains were
        drawn, safely fixed and securely closed so that no light
        would escape to the outside; a small trapdoor opening to
        the kitchen was closed.The windowsill had many plants on
        it, and in one corner stood a small round coffee table with
        two matching armchairs, a tablecloth and flower pot deco -
        rated the setting.
        It was cozy and warm in the darkened room.
        I sat down in one of the arm -
        chairs in my gray coat, tired, con -
        fused, scared, clutching my little
        brown teddy bear, my only friend
        and possession, slowly slipping
        deeper into the armchair drooping
        my head and falling asleep.
        ìCome, î said the lady of the
        house.ìIíll bring him upstairs, î she
        announced to the others in the room,
        The Chair
        and, leading me by the hand, she brought me upstairs to
        her bedroom, took off my shoes, coat, etc.and placed me on
        her bed to sleep.ìSleep well, î she said.ìYouíll be safe for
        34
        The House
        now.î She went back downstairs, spoke to her husband for
        a short while, then spoke to Angela Leoni and Ben Kejl.
        (Ben was the in -between person who operated in this area: I
        was handed over to him and he in turn brought me to my
        hiding place.This system was safer, as not every one knew
        all the facts.Among his duties, Ben supplied us during the
        war with the essential food distribution coupons.) They had
        decided, right then and there, to upgrade their status from a
        ìrest stop, î to a ìpermanentî hiding place, and that all con -
        tacts should be held to a minimum for safetyís sake.All nec -
        essary paperwork, identity card etc.should from now on be
        written with a new name, ìJoopie Bakkerî(Johnny the Baker)
        as they decided to call me.
        It was a magnificent house.Two stories high, built of
        light beige bricks, dark gray roof tiles.Wood - trimmed glass
        and lead windows, a heavy wooden front door, nicely deco -
        rated; a half round bay window protruding outwards
        belonging to the salon, and on the side a patio bordered by
        the dining room on the one side, and a huge glass wall on
        the other.
        Surrounding the house was an extremely large and
        beautifully decorated garden with many lovely flowers,
        plants and bushes artistically arranged in special garden
        patches bordering the huge lawn in the center.
        The walk paths were covered with gravel that proved to
        be our alarm system if someone approached the house.In
        the middle of the front lawn stood a huge tilted - over,
        ìundecoratedî flagpole.There was no flag on display, as it
        was strictly forbidden.
        Crossing the garden, (going west) there was a structure
        that served as the garage for the automobile that the physi -
        cian was allowed to have at the beginning of the war; fuel
        for the car was rationed so the authorities could keep track.
        35
        My Early Years
        Very close behind the kitchen, that had a door leading
        to the back of the garden, was another small building, par -
        tially hidden by trees and shrubs: a storage room for garden
        utensils, bicycles, etc.This outhouse would also play a
        prominent part in our lives as well as the crossing of the
        garden to the garage.
        Halfway in the direction of the street was a large bicycle
        rack, bordered by the lawn.

        The House: Bicycle rack in foreground; gravel path is our ìearly warning
        system.î Gravel pathway goes to side entrance door, ìthe waiting and
        practiceî area.The walk continues around the house to the rear where it meets
        the kitchen door.It then continues past the kitchen, to the patio, makes a turn,
        past the dining room, the side of the house, around the salon, and back to the
        front door.
        37
        My Early Years
        Downstairs
        Right next to the main entrance was a small wall about one
        meter high and half a meter wide separating the main
        entrance door and the toilet bordering it.Next to it was the
        spacious salon with a large bay window.The dining room,
        next to it the large kitchen, a small hallway with entrance to
        the cellar and an entrance to a smaller room, which served
        as pharmacy, that adjoined the large consultation room,
        vestibule with entrance, and waiting room.
        The consultation and waiting room had a separate
        doorway via the vestibule, which was the side entrance of
        the house.Joining the gravel path that led to the front door,
        it widened towards the street.Between the joining of the
        paths and the street was a large bicycle rack on the left hand
        side.
        Connecting all the rooms in the lower part of the house
        was the enormous hallway with, on one side, the large
        staircase that wound its way to the upstairs level.
        Outside the dining room was a patio, a balcony
        enclosed in glass.

        Downstairs
        Floor plans are not according to scale.
        39
        My Early Years
        Upstairs
        Upstairs were three large bedrooms, a small room adjoin -
        ing the master bedroom, (which was my room) overlooking
        the roof of the glass patio.
        There was also a bathroom and a landing with a railing
        made of beautiful carved wood that went around to the
        other rooms, with the gaping hole of the central staircase in
        the middle.
        The entrance to the attic consisted of two parts: the
        lower attic and, going up a sturdy ladder, you came to the
        upper floor of the attic space, right under the roof.
        I could walk there standing straight up; an adult had to
        keep his head down while going towards the sides.There
        was not much light on the upper level.
        All the windows in the house were of the beautiful glass
        and lead kind; these are small window panes set in a lead
        framework.The windows were quite large and very flexi -
        ble, as we found out later on.
        40
        Upstairs
        This was my home for the next three years.ìYou can
        call us Tante en Oom(Aunt and Uncle), î I was told the next
        morning, while I sat cautiously at the large wooden table.A
        gentle lady: ìYou call me ëAunt Alií and this is ëUncle
        Piet, íî as she pointed to the tall gentleman standing next to
        her.ìAnd we will call you ëJoopie Bakker.íî I was clutching
        my little brown teddy bearóbesides my few clothes, it was
        my only belonging.Again I was told the rules of the game:
        not to speak to anyone, to be silent, not to go outside the
        house, and absolutely not to go near the windows.
        ìUncle Piet is a doctor, î said the lady.ìHis practice is at
        home, and I(Aunt Ali) am a pharmacist.We prepare the
        medicines so people come to the door and to the doctorís
        office.They come usually in the afternoon by appointment,
        41
        My Early Years
        and in the early evenings to pick up the medicines.If by
        chance anyone does ask, you know your name, and you are
        visiting your Aunt and Uncle.î These were the first instruc -
        tions I received.
        I very quickly familiarized myself with the enormous
        house.My sleeping quarters were in a little room next to
        the master bedroom so Aunt and Uncle could keep an eye
        on me and so I wouldnít be alone.I spent a lot of time in the
        cellar, which was under the house; there were no windows,
        it was insulated from the average noise, and had only one
        entrance or exit: the staircase that went up to the kitchen
        hallway.
        There was a niche in the cellar hidden by a large
        wooden wardrobe that stood a bit askew; there was just
        enough room for me to crawl behind and sort of disappear.
        As there was hardly any light in the cellar, and the spaces
        behind the closet and niche were invisible.The air was stale
        and mildew covered the damp walls.
        The floor was scattered with boxes, canned food, apples
        from the garden and other goods that should be kept cool.I
        could easily pick my way to the secret hiding place.
        My instructions were that once I was hidden I was not
        to come out of there under any circumstance until called by
        Aunt Ali or Uncle Piet.
        Sometimes I was allowed to accompany Aunt Ali to the
        attic when she arranged the pharmaceuticals that were
        stored there.Among them were a couple of exceptionally
        large glass bottles wrapped in straw baskets to prevent
        breakage during transport.Each straw basket had two han -
        dles to lift the bottle and its liquid contents.The attic was
        very dimly lit, as the single small light bulb was right next
        to the attic entrance door and the light switch () was hid -
        den behind a heavy wooden beam that stood slanted; it was
        42
        Upstairs
        part of the roof structure, so that if someone did not know
        this the switch could not be found.The rest of the attic
        space was dark, and in the middle was a rough wooden
        ladder to the upper deck to a crawl space under the roof
        tiles.
        One such bottle was prepared as an emergency hiding
        place; the basket itself was large enough to hide a small
        boy.The glass bottle was cut and taken out, leaving only
        the top remaining as a decoy, made in such a manner that it
        could hinge.Once inside I myself could pull the cover to
        close the opening and become invisible.The bottles were
        placed under and behind the ladder() to give the impres -
        sion that they were just debris that was never cleared away.
        Here too, the same ìinstructionsî applied.
        Many a time we rehearsed the escape procedures.It
        was like a game of hide and seek with fatal end results if
        found.Of course it goes without saying that those rehears -
        als were executed with the utmost precision and silence.
        I was well trained; a wink of the eye or movement of the
        hand was the signal, as Aunt Ali and Uncle Piet controlled
        the situation and protected me for three long years from the
        evil which was all around us.
        Of course there were no revealing marks of a child ever
        present in this house: no toys, no clothing lying around, no
        crayons, or other such informing signs.
        It was for me a very sad day when my only friend and
        precious possession, my little brown teddy bear, was taken
        away.The ìteddyî has to go, Aunt Ali ruled; it was ìdirty,
        ripped, and downright dangerousî to drag it along with
        me, specially to such places as the cellar or attic hideaway.
        Naturally there was no school for me to attend.Aunt
        Ali, who had experience as a school teacher, decided to give
        me school lessons: imagine your own private school and
        43
        My Early Years
        teacher.I was taught the basics of what a first year school
        pupil should learn: the alphabet, reading, writing and
        counting.She told me, from time to time, to write a letter to
        my parents; she told me at many occasions, and especially
        if I asked about them, that they would soon come to visit
        me.Whenever I had ìwrittenî a letter I was asked ìCan
        you tell us what you wrote ? î I would then sit under the
        table in the dining room and read out loud what I had writ -
        ten in the so - called letter.
        For them such ìso - called lettersî were an indication of
        how I felt; it was like an open window to my thoughts.
        Ali and Piet always told me that I would stay with them
        for a while, that my parents would soon come to pick me
        up, and that in the meantime they would take care of me
        and hide me from bad people who wanted to catch and
        hurt me.
        I was well - hidden and protected from evil and from the
        farmers who came to see the doctor.Even during the time
        that the most beautiful garden was being ruined by the
        occupiers, I was not in view of anyone.The garden, it was
        decided, must be traversed by a large ditch; it was neces -
        sary, according to the announcement, to hide tanks and
        personnel carriers from the spying eyes of aircraft that occa -
        sionally flew in the area.In any case, there was no point in
        objecting, since they would do whatever they wanted any -
            way.
        And so a ditch that went from end to end through the
        garden was dug.Where it originated and where it wentó
        how long it wasónobody knew.
        It completely separated the garage from the house.It
        took almost the entire width; it was more than a ìtankî
        wide and was extremely deep.Any tank moving in that
        ditch would really be invisible from ground level.The road
        44
        Upstairs
        in front of the house was also dug up to let the trench pass;
        wooden planks were put over it in order for light vehicles
        to pass over.Uncle Piet complained that in an emergency it
        would take him too long to get to his car, and, besides, there
        was no way of crossing it.
        The engineers built him two rough wooden ladders,
        one for each end, that were put on the sides of the ditch and
        held in place in the mud by a few supports.Two rough
        wooden planks were laid across the bottom of the mud to
        prevent one from sinking too deep in the soft rain - drenched
        ground.ìNow it will be easier, î the commander explained;
        ìall you have to do is go down the ladder, cross, climb up
        the ladder, and get your car.î
        Later on it proved to be a most valuable piece of con -
        struction.
        One fine day, after Uncle Piet was well accustomed to
        ìgoing to the garageî he perceived a brilliant idea.He told
        Aunt Ali: ìWell, lookówhen I return from the garage and
        climb up the ladder, I do not know, nor see, what is behind
        the ladder, tucked away in the mud, now what, ifÖî
        I then received new instructions: ìIf there is a need for a
        hiding place outside of the house you go quickly down the
        ladder and push yourself into the mud, wiggling your way
        deeper and deeper.Make sure you make your hands and
        face black, and you stay there until we call you.î It was
        rehearsed in mind only, as it was too dangerous to go out
        and actually make a realistic performance of it.
        It came to that stage, during the harsh winter of 1944,
        with not enough food to go around, the loudspeakers on
        the school building close to the house blared out the procla -
        mation that was also pasted on walls all over the village:
        ìAnyone who delivers a Jew, Gypsy, or other undesir -
        ableóany person who is being searched forówill receive
        45
        My Early Years
        for his efforts half a loaf of white bread.î
        Unsuspecting of the goings - on at the school headquar -
        ters, one dayóI do not remember the time of day any -
        moreóa few vehicles screeched to a halt on the road in
            front of our house.A quick glance of Uncle Piet out the win -
            dow revealed a large number of soldiers coming towards
        the house.Piet decided that this was not a friendly visit.He
        tried to stall for time and told Ali, ìQuick, hurryóget rid of
        the boy, here they are.î Aunt Ali calmly took me to the
        kitchenís back entrance, quickly put on my coat, and told
        me,
        ìRemember what we told you: go to the ladder, dig
        into the mud, make yourself invisible and stay there till I
        call you.î Just in time I ran out of the house.The mass of
        soldiers had been tipped off by a farmer who came to head -
        quarters to collect his prize; they came through the front
        door, and the side door(practiceówaiting room); some of
        them went around to the rear kitchen door, but I was
        already gone.Ali and Piet remained calm knowing that I
        was out of the house and would be invisible.The Gestapo
        personnel searched the house, looked everywhere, and
        found nothing.
        They summoned Ali and Piet into the dining room and
        the officer in charge said, ìWe know you are hiding a small
        boy here.Where is he ? î
        Uncle Piet asked: ìWho would tell you such a thing ?
        we, trusted as we are by your people, would do a thing like
        that ? î
        ìA farmer informed on you, î he said.ìHe thought that
        he heard a child crying!î
        ìWell, that is possible, î Piet answered, ìbut the child
        must have been a patient here, as we have no children, and
        you know that.î
        ìWell, î the officer said, ìin any case the search did not
        46
        Upstairs
        show up anything, but how can we be sure ? î After a while
        he came up with an idea: he told Ali and Piet, ìLook here, if
        you are hiding a child, sooner or later the child will start
        crying; you will have to give it something to eat and to
        drink.Until then we will stay here in the house and so we
        will discover who is telling the truth.î
        Knowing that I was outside the house, Ali and Piet did
        not respond; they remained calm.They knew they had no
        other choice except to agree, for otherwise it might demon -
        strate to the contrary.
        Some of the soldiers settled down for a long wait, others
        kept on searching the house, and at the same time started
        sealing of all the doors.
        The sealing of the doors was done by fastening a thin
        metal wire with red wax to the doorpost and the door itself;
        the wax was heated and the liquefied wax would stick to
        anything, and it was then stamped with a metal imprint
        displaying the engraved seal of the Gestapo.This way, by
        opening the door, the seal would break. It would be a sure
        give - away.The only doors not sealed in the house were the
        passage from kitchen to dining room, to the pharmacy, con -
        sultation room and the toilet.Upstairs bedrooms were all
        sealed; nobody went upstairsóa soldier on guard duty
        made sure of that.Others who had nothing to do went for a
        walk outside, checked the building behind the kitchen that
        was used as a storage room for the garden tools and bicy -
        cles.They checked the garage, they looked in and under
        bushes, gave the garden a general check up and found
        nothing.
        After more than twenty - four hours no crying was
        heard, no sign of hidden children was noticed; even while
        they observed Ali and Piet they acted calmly and no seals
        had been broken.The commanding officer in charge
        47
        My Early Years
        decided that it must have been a false alarm.
        They finally left, yet giving a warning: ìWe will be back
        to check the doors whenever we want.î Piet did not hesitate
        to say ìDo me a favor.Allow us to use our bedroom so we
        can sleep at night.î The wish was granted, and the upstairs
        bedroom and adjoining bathroom became unsealed for the
        time being.
        I heard my name but I did not react; I was too cold, too
        hungry and thirsty.I was just numb, had no feeling, noth -
        ing.
        How long I stood there in the mud, under the ladder,
        pushed inside the dark earth, I have no idea, but now that
        the ordeal was over Aunt Ali took me out of the ditch and
        into the house.That same night I was brought to a family in
        the town of Zwolle(my fifth hiding place).I stayed there for
        three weeks with two elderly ladies.
        Of what happened next I have no recollection anymore.
        After I was safely tucked away in another hiding place
        Uncle Piet went to the headquarters school to announce
        that, ìI am sorry to notify you, but since our family needs a
        doctor, my wife and I are leaving the house for a while.î
        He thought it would better to be safe than sorry, and so
        they really did go ìhomeî to the town of Dedemsvaart
        where their family lived.
        They found it safer not to be at home for a while after
        that search episode, and it proved to have been the right
        decision, and everything in the course of time settled down.
        After a very short while Uncle Piet returned home first,
        continued his practice, a short while thereafter Aunt Ali
        returned as well; the pharmacy and the house returned to
        normal.At long last, I returned as well.Our daily lives con -
        tinued as before, except for the experience and the traumas
        it left behind.

        Upstairs
        As a reminder of this highly dangerous, life - threatening
        episode, one seal, though broken, always remained on the
        door post() of the consultation room: the door next to the
        staircase going to the upper floor.I remember seeing it
        there the last time I visited the house, just prior to my
        departure to New York in 1958.
        My return from Zwolle had one benefit: it was told in
        the village that a ìsick childî of the doctors family had
        come to recuperate.It was a very thin camouflage in case I
        was detected, or was heard by anyone coming for doctors
        consultations or picking up medicines in the waiting room.
        Those coming from that side always gave sufficient warn -
        ing because of the lengthy gravel path from the road to the
        side door.But then, one never knew what to expect, as we
        already had experienced.
        Daily life kept its regular routine; of course I must have
        been sick from time to time, and there must have been other
        exceptional happenings, but not many I can recall.Evi -
        dently only those that must have made the biggest impres -
        sion on me and have been shocking at the time, I do
        remember.
        A farmer came to visit and brought some food, a pail of
        eelsóa kind of edible water snake.Almost black in color,
        thin and extremely slippery, they crawl, slither and slide
        over and under each other like giant worms.The farmer
        cleaned them in the kitchen outhouse.On the table was a
        container with sawdust; he dipped his hand into the saw -
        dust, grabbed a handful, took an eel and with a sharp knife
        ripped it open lengthwise.The sawdust preventing the eel
        from slithering away, he pulled the insides out, cut the eels
        into a couple of pieces and dropped them into the cooking
        pot.It was brought to the kitchen and put on the fire to sim -
        mer on the stove.
        49
        My Early Years
        I could not restrain myself any longer; slightly opening
        the cover of the pot while it was still cooking, I saw all the
        pieces of eel crawling and wiggling.
        That same evening at the table I did not want to eat.
        Uncle Piet said, while laughing, ìWell, if you do not want
        them, than Iíll have some more.î And he helped himself to
        another portion.
        I once had a toothache, which was trouble; it was
        infected and swollen as well, and had to come out.Luckily
        for me the bad tooth(an incisor) was already loose.Uncle
        Piet was not a dentist, and he did not want to hurt me, so
        after thinking things over he thought up the following solu -
        tion.
        He sat me down in a large chair that was tied up
        securely, then tied me up as well and put a strong wire
        around the bad tooth.He tied the other end to the door han -
        dle, held me tightly in place, and yelled ìAli, can you come
        here a moment, quickly ? î As Aunt Ali pulled the door open
        to come into the room, the wire tightened andÖ the tooth
        was extracted.Post - dental treatment was taken care of, as
        the pharmacy was at home.
        As the years went by a decree was issued by which all
        vehicles were to be handed over to the Nazi occupiers.Dis -
        obediently Piet arranged for the car to ìdisappear;î the car,
        a D.K.W., was brought to another village and hidden at a
        friendly farm in a haystack.In order to prevent damage
        during the harsh cold winters, the liquids of the motor were
        drained and the tires removed.
        A long time later during a search at the friendly farm a
        tire was found.As the search and interrogation of the
        farmer went on he persistently declared that he did not
        know anything about the tire, how it got there, or to whom
        it belonged.
        50
        Upstairs
        One day, suddenly, an officer came up to the door.Ali,
        completely taken by surprise, opened the door and the
        army officer walked into the house, inquiring if ìHerr Doc -
        torî was home.He wanted to look for information about
        Herr Doctorís automobile.
        As I was sitting at the table in the dining room, doing
        some ìschool work, î Ali, being afraid that the Nazi had
        seen me, suddenly started to scream at me.
        ìHow many times do I have to tell you: you did every -
        thing wrong! Do it again, do it fast and do it good, î she
        ordered sternly.I was confused by the outburst.
        She explained to the officer that she gave this child extra
        school lessons since he was absent from school because of
        sickness.
        M
        I developed a habit: while sitting at the table for meals I
        put my left arm and hand under my head as if the head was
        too heavy to hold up straight; it must have been a kind of
        nonchalant behavior.Repeatedly I was told, ìSit up straight
        and take your arm away, î but to no avail.ìThese are not
        table manners, î was another version, but there are times
        when a child of that age just does not listen.
        Uncle Piet warned me many times.ìWait, î he said.
        ìWait and you will see what will happen.î Well, nothing
        happened until the fifth of December, the traditional day of
        ìSaint Nicolas:î a special day to commemorate the birthday
        of the Spanish Saint by the name of Nicolas who was
        known to have been exceptional good to children.Children
        were usually afraid during this sinister time, weeks before
        the coming of Saint Nicolas, because the saint usually
        brought with him gifts for the well - behaved children, and
        punished the disobedient ones.
        51
        My Early Years
        I also received a present; it was waiting for me at the
        breakfast table, nicely wrapped.ìWell, go on, open it, î I
        was urged.It looked awfully long and wide.I opened the
        covering and out cameÖa piece of peat, a bit flattened on
        the one side, and a bit hollowed out on the other.ìJopie, do
        you know what this is ? î asked Aunt Ali.I was just sitting
        and looking at it and Uncle Piet said, ìI know what it is: it is
        a headrest.Jopie does not have to use his arm and hand the
        whole time while eating.î How embarrassing! ìYou see, î
        he said, ìeven Saint Nicolas does not approve of how you
        sit at the table.î
        From then on I never again put my hands under my
        head.
        M
        The windows, small glass panes, fixed into a lead
        frame, were rattling frantically; the entire house was shak -
        ing, and it also became dark outside.The sky filled with air -
        - planes, a lower level going to the southeast, an upper level
        going exactly in the opposite way.This was the observation
        as I peeked through the window of the dining room that
        had a clear view over the ìtank ditchî and looked out in the
        direction of the garage and the street.The rattling became
        worse, and everything now started to shake.Ali and Piet
        ordered me to go into the cellar; they did, but I preferred to
        stay in the corner of the little wall that separated the toilet
        in the hall from the front door.This wall, I convinced
        myself, would stay standing, and I would be safe there.At
        the time we did not know where the bombs were falling;
        only later did we learn that it was the famous Battle of Arn -
        hem.The Allied forces had arrived; some came by land
        with all the heavy equipment from the Belgian border, and
        an advance group parachuted into the area.The bridges
        52
        Upstairs
        had been blown up to make it impossible to cross the rivers.
        The airborne divisionís task was to pacify in the area, to
        establish a bridgehead on the banks of the mighty river
        Rhine, and to expedite the crossing of the river which
        would decisively alter the question of ìwho rules where.î
        Meanwhile the German Luftwaffe had the upper hand
        (upper wing ?) at this timeóbut not for long, since the
        Allied forces showed up with aircraft to bomb other targets
        in Germany and to engage the enemy in the air.
        All the time, while this was going on, our house was
        trembling and rattling.I stood faithfully in my corner,
        pressed against the little wall, and from time to time Ali or
        Piet would come to sit with me; also they inspected the
        house for damage from the vibrations.Luckily there was
        none; the house held firm, for it was a strongly - built house
        and could withstand a trembling.

        Airplanes kept on coming, day after day; anti - aircraft
        guns fired at random.
        At night the sky would light up from the enormous
        searchlights that were weaving and probing the darkened
        heavens, playing hide and seek with the clouds and casting
        53
        My Early Years
        evil shadows.
        Air raid sirens would wail as a sign of approaching
        disaster.
        It was a frightening time.
        One such morning our lives were once more abruptly
        disturbed.This time it was an allied aerial attack on a very
        unusual German freight train, that, for some unexplained
        reason, passed on the one single track that was never used.
        At the time I was at the home of my ìoppasî(care -
        taker)óAnneke, a girl of thirteen, who, many times after
        school, would come by to help a bit in the household, do
        some chores around the house, sometimes watch me, or
        keep me company.
        On occasion she would take me with her so I could play
        with her little brother.She and her family lived in one of
        seven houses next to the railway track.The back yards
        served as vegetable patches and bordered the railway track.
        In the front yard were more patches where illegal pota -
        toes were grown; muddy footprints stamped down a path
        that led to the Eijerdijk, a few hundred meters away.
        We kids were playing in front of the house near the
        entrance to the underground shelter when suddenly
        Annekeís father picked us both up and threw us down the
        stairs into the shelter and closed the hatch.The shelter con -
        tinued deep under the house.We were both aching from
        the fall and were scared.
        The hatch, a double door, was camouflaged to look like
        part of the garden patches, and was invisible when closed.
        It was well - concealed.
        We could hear the plane engines roar, the whistling of
        the bombs, the explosions, and the screaming of human
        beings that accompanied the train.
        The train was hit, the steam engine exploded, and
        54
        Upstairs
        shortly afterwards the place was swarming with uniforms
        of all colors.
        The ground trembled from the impact of the bombs.
        Later that night, under cover of darkness, I was safely
        brought home.
        It was rumored that a few planes had been shot down,
        and the Nazis were frantically looking for the pilots
        believed to be hiding in the area.
        As the Germans were desperately searching for the
        pilots it was thought that they had parachuted into the area
        while abandoning their aircraft.They were hiding some -
        where.
        The hunters continued, enraged with anger, for days on
        end.
        At our house it was decided to prevent drawing any
        special attention; if and when the hunters arrived to interro -
        gate us about what we knew about the train incident, they
        would say that I was a son of a relative who came to visit, to
        recuperate, and to be under a physicianís observation.
        With this pretext well rehearsed, it could be ventured to
        take me out of doors, to go to church, make an appearance
        just in case anyone had observed me and had any doubts
        about my being at the doctorís house.
        That Sunday morning, dressed up in my best, we
        walked the rather short distance, like all other residents of
        the village, to church.
        Aunt Ali said ìGive me a handî as we walked briskly
        across the square to the main entrance of the church.A cou -
        ple of Gestapo soldiers stood at the door checking every -
        body who went in.As we entered, the guards looked at me,
            and one soldier stretched his hand out and put it on top of
        my head, rubbed his hand through my curly hair.ìNice lit -
        tle boy!!î he said.ìYeah, î said Aunt Ali.ìMy sisterís boy is
        55
        My Early Years
        here with me; the family is sick.î At the same time, as I was
        taught and trained, I dipped my little hand into the ìHoly
        Water Fountain, î took it out, water still dripping, made a
        Cross, and respectfully dropped a knee.ìNice little boy, î
        the soldier repeated once more, ìWonder ifÖî ìHe is like
        us, Protestant, î Ali answered quickly, and the soldier with-
        drew his hand while Uncle Piet gave me a shove to con -
        tinue walking.
        We found a pew, and sat down to pray thankfully.
        It was a bit too close for comfort, but it proved to be the
        right decision, as they never found the pilots and Ali and
        Piet did not want a repeat performance of a house search.
        Magere Brug(Lean Bridge) over the river Amstel.The bridge, a landmark in
        Amsterdam, is made from wood and is very narrow(lean).To open it in the
        old days a number of pedestrians had to pull a metal chain on each side in
        order to allow the bridge to open for passing ships.

        Copy of letter
        This document was found among the multitude of papers during my task of
        cleaning out the house after Uncle Piet passed away in July 2002. I knew that
        there were downed pilots, but I had no idea that they were hidden in the
        neighborhood and received medical assistance from none other than Ali and
        Piet van Haeringen.They simply would never talk about things like that.
        They were rather shy, did not want to be outstanding or to be in the glare of
        publicity and certainly not want to draw attention to themselves.This was
        the everlasting trademark that accompanied them throughout their lives.It is
        our duty to mankind to help those in need, they always told me.

        On the sixteenth of June 1961 the city of Hattem orga -
        nized a gigantic event and invited all past and present
        patients, babies and children who had been brought into
        the world by Doctor Van Haeringen.The territory of opera -
        57
        My Early Years
        tions was the township of Hattem and its surroundings.It
        was broadcast on national television a few days later.After
        the ceremony a reception was held where the population
        could express their thanks.
        In front of City Hall, Hattem
        The Mayor of Hattem, who stood at the head of the
        committee, sent out more than a thousand invitations taken
        from the database of the patient administration.

        Parade of Babies to Honor the Physician
        Doctor van Haeringen started his practice in Hattem
        after graduating from the University in Groningen.
        As earlier described, he built his residence there and
        continuously was ìThe Doctor, î even through the darkest
        days of history, and he did not hesitate to help those in
        need.Both Ali and Piet certainly made history, as twenty -
        five years later a multitude of people came to the city
        square in Hattem to thank them.
        Market Square, Hattem
        59
        My Early Years
        Quickly the square filled with old and new patients
        from all over the district to pay tribute to ìThe Doctor and
        his Wifeî for all they had done over the last twenty - five
        years.
        According to official papers the license to practice med -
        icine was issued in Hattem on 16 June 1936.
        After ending his career as Hattemís physician, Ali and
        Piet moved to Gorinchem, a town in the province of Zuid -
        - Holland.He worked there in the capacity as a school physi -
        cian, as well as the doctor in a institute for handicapped
        children.
        They moved to the town of Apeldoorn in 1976, back to
        the province of Gelderland, approximately thirty kilometers
        from their former resident town of Hattem.
        Being both retired now, they still gave medical advice
        and kept a modest office at their residenceóall to help the
        needy.
        The caricatures above were framed and hung in the waiting room
        60
        Liberation
        There was this excitement outside in the street, people were
        running back and forth.Voices penetrated the walls of the
        house: ìWe are free, we are free!î Ali and Piet went care -
        fully to the salon and looked through the window; yes, peo -
        ple were running and screaming; in the distance there was
        shooting and heavy rumblings.
        We were just about to make preparations to hang the
        ìRed - White - Blueî flag on the flagpole in the garden when a
        couple of farmers passed by screaming, ìHide, hideóthe
        Germans are coming.î Then, a short while later, just the
        opposite happened.ìWe are free, we are free!î No, they
        were wrong, but in any case it was better to wait yet a while
        with the flag.Another day passed by, and yes, it was true,
        the ground reverberated as the rumbling sound of
        approaching tanks came nearer and nearer.We went care -
        fully outside, standing on the gravel path next to the prac -
        tice entrance, soldiers in green uniforms were running in all
        directions, some even tried to get rid of their clothes while
        being chased by the crowd, even in our street a tank
        appeared, triumphant soldiers sat on top; they were hand -
        ing out chocolate.I looked at Aunt Ali and both of us went
        closer to the road, and a Canadian soldier threw me a choc -
        olate bar.I picked it up from the ground.Uncle Piet came
        with the flag; yes, now we could put it on the flagpole.
        Slowly but surely it was hoisted to the top of the mast, with
        the Orange banner on top, we were free, the war was over.
        Yes, I was standing in the sunlight.
        Some farmers were running down the street, their hay
        forks in hand.They caught a fleeing Gestapo officer and
        captured him.He was dragged to the village water pump at
        the end of the Dorpsweg.He was hung upside down from
        the sloping roof of the adjoining building.Other farmers
        61
        My Early Years
        came with pieces of wood, all kind of debris, anything they
        could find that could burn, and it was piled up under the
        captured man.
        A enormous crowd of vil -
        lagers assembled.It was now
        their turn to vent their anger,
        their revenge.The heaped - up
        rubbish was set on fire.The
        apprehended officer plead for
        his life to no avail.The crowd
        was jeering, ìIt is now your
        turn to suffer.î
        The flames and the smoke
        of the fire rose up to the
        unfortunate man, dangling
        and jumping on the rope that
        held him suspended from the
        roof.
        The flames caught his hair, his clothes; he was burning,
        the crowd cheering.
        It so happened that Aunt Ali and I turned the corner of
        the Eijerdijk and Dorpsweg and we saw this episode in the
        not to far distance; we just followed the crowd going in that
        direction.
        Even today the trauma is still with me; I still see the
        man burning and hear his screams.

        May 1945, filling the ìtank ditchî and restoring the garden
        1. Small windows panes of dining room; 2. Salon bay window; 3. Wooden
        shoes
        The nightmare was over; now the rebuilding, fixing and
        clean up started.
        I was pleased that I was allowed to help fill in the ditch.
        I was dressed for the occasion and outfitted with wooden
        shoes.
        The wooden shoes() were handcrafted by a certain
        Mr.Neuteboom, also a member of the secret resistance
        fighters.This was told to me by his daughter Gerda, whom
        I met in July 2002 at the funeral ceremony of Piet van
        Haeringen.Gerda was the second baby delivered in the
        long medical career of the Family Doctor.
        The ground was wet and mushy.A wooden wheelbar -
        row ran on wooden planks laid out over the ground.It was
        much too heavy for me to lift or push; it was sufficient for
        63
        My Early Years
        me to ìsuperviseî the proceedings as, slowly, the ditch was
        filled.For a while the ground was too soft to walk on it as
        one would sink into the soft aerated soil.
        Trees, shrubs, flower beds and the lawn were restored,
            the gravel paths raked.
        In the end, the garden was restored in all its splendor.
        After the liberation, on the fifth of May 1945, very
        slowly life started to return to normal, as much as it could
        be called that way.
        Being that there was a shortage of virtually everything,
        and foods and other goods were in short supply, coupons
        were issued.Each person received a ìdistribution cardî on
